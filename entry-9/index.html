    <p>i fear i'm beginning to sound a bit old-fashioned.</p>&nbsp; 
    <p><i>'nothing does it for me like a honest-to-goodness piece of paper...when i was your age, i used to walk back and forth from the papery in the snow/sleet/hail/torrential rain just to catch a glimpse of some sweet...sweet BFK rives...to just touch a crisp copy of hamlet...real literature...'</i></p>&nbsp;
    <p>i know. and i apologize for my tone, reader. i promise, i'm not nearly as senile as my preferences suggest.</p>&nbsp;

<h4>'that is the question'</h4>
<h3>(hamlet; act III, scene 1)</h3>&nbsp;
    <p>the thing about books, it seems, is that they are a dying art. even i, the worshipper of words and sligner of solliquies in favor of print media, have fallen victim to this mindset. i would be remiss to say that there isn't a degree of truth to it all. books are, as we've established, among the oldest and simpliest means of storytelling available. symbols, that everyone (literate) can understand, in a package (a book) that everyone (with hands) can hold. fairly non-exclusionary, fairly accessible, <i>undoubedtly</i> rhudimentary.</p>&nbsp;
    <p>the novel is tried-and-true. the greats have beaten us all to the good punches: right-hook-storytelling of friends, romans, countrymen, vengeful sons, and two households (both like in dignity.) i say the greats, but i mean the <i>great,</i> of course.</p>&nbsp;

    <p>W. SHAKESPEARE</p>&nbsp;
        <p>upon the mortal stage where shadows dance,<hr> i, willy, donnéd the quill, my sole lance.<hr> in fair stratford's cradle i took my breath,<hr> a brilliant bard, in with life and death.<hr></p>&nbsp;
        <p>with ink-stained fingers and a poet's eye,<hr> i summoned tales that reachéd the sky.<hr> in sonnets sweet, love's fire i did ignite,<hr> and tragedy, with tears, i did incite.<hr></p>&nbsp;
        <p> my verses, like a river, floweth free,<hr> a current that transcends both time and sea.<hr> in comedies, the world found mirth and glee,<hr> a jest, a laugh, a timeless jubilee.<hr></p>&nbsp;
        <p>so, let this be a sonnet to declare,<hr> mine homage to the bard beyond compare.</p>&nbsp;
