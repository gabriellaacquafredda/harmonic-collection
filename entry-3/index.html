    <h4 style="text-align:center;"> baby's first words: <i class="medi">color</i>
    </h4>&nbsp;
    <hr class="line"> &nbsp; <p>i'm inclined to lead with an anecdote:</p> &nbsp; <p>there exists some friendly dispute over my first spoken word. beyond the standard "mama swears it was <i>mama,</i>" and "dada heard <i>dada,</i> clear as day," my parents are awfully certain that my first word was 'blue.' (i could choose a favorite color, but not a favorite parent.) &nbsp;certain parties (ie: my grandmother, who was privy to the events,) say it was definetly 'boo.' halloween was right around the corner at the time. blue seems more likley, but i am not one to question my grandmother's word. </p> &nbsp; <p>i digress. what i said then doesn't matter nearly as much as what i'm going to show & tell you now:</p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;<p style="text-align: center;"><i>blue is a color.</i>
    </p> &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
    <p>i know, you could have told me this. <i>i</i> could have told me this, at a handful of months old, supposedly. </p> &nbsp; <p>but i state the obvious for abstract reasons. 'color,' like 'matter,' and 'language,' is a loaded word: chock-full of multiple meanings and interpretations. there are literal, conceptual, denotative, connotative, and colloquial understandings of color; some of which are not even connected to the visible spectrum, but the nature of the word itself. and given that we are on a journey through 'word world,' that is the lense through which we will attempt to process color.</p> &nbsp;

      <hr class="line"> &nbsp; <h5 text="text-align:center" class="bigi">...that's a lot of words for a baby</h5>
      <p>i know we're supposed to be addressing the basics of color...but i have a tendency to get over-excited when it comes to this stuff. </p> &nbsp; <p>in the spirit of simplicity, i've prepared a little picture book for you.</p>

    <br>&nbsp; <p class="subscript;" style="text-align: right;">would have been easier to just say 'blue...'</p> &nbsp; <p>but there really isn't a simplier way to capture it.</p> &nbsp; <p>the beauty of the written word is contained in these idiosyncracies of meaning; and the notion that a separate vernacular exists for the sole purpose of describing the existing one is a beautiful thing.</p> &nbsp;
