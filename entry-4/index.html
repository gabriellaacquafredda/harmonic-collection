    <h4 style="text-align:center;"> baby's (second) first words: <i class="bigi">shape</i></h4>
&nbsp;
<hr class="line">
<p>i'm certain you've noticed by now, but the shape of what we're doing here has undergone some change. i am a believer in the 'walk before you run' principle of all things; and i am accepting these fluctations in form as such. that metaphor is a front for the fact that <i>code is a written language of it's own,</i> and it's possibly the only one i haven't extensively studied. i would love to pretend that my passion for language is enough to materialize all of this automatically, but i am not artifically intelligent, and i was never all that good at playing pretend. (as far as you know, i am a baby who only knows two words.)  </p>
    <p style="text-align: right">with that, let's talk <i>shape.</i></p>
&nbsp;
<p>dear reader, dear baby, you are growing so fast. last i saw you, we'd just explored color from every angle on the visible and theorhetical spectrum. you'll find that 'shape' is simmilar in a lot of ways: simple at a glance, and kaliedoscopic when you squint.</p>

<div class="text-container">
    <p>a shape is defined by webster's as:</p>
    <span class="rotating-text" id="word"></span>
</div>
&nbsp;
<p>but we'll start with what i assume to be our collective childish instinct.</p>
