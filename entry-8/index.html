    <p style="text-align: right">on the surface, that's pretty much it.</p>&nbsp;
    <p> i hope and assume you've been taking notes all this time. the mandatory exam is coming up at the end of all my words, after all. i've heard it's a tricky one. one <i>huge</i> monospaced essay on everything i've taught you up to this point. and, of course, how you will use your newfound knowledge to alter the world.</p>

<!-- section 2 -->

<h4>the real important things</h4>
<h3>cultivating, curating, and taking a moment</h3>&nbsp;
    <p>i hope and assume, dear reader, that you were able to pick up on my sarcasm.</p>&nbsp; 
    <p>no need to fret over an essay, it's not requried. though, honest-to-goodness, i encourage it. the purpose of <i>printed matters,</i> this project, this great-big-essay, is to get you, reader, excited about words in all their forms. words on websites, and words on paper, and words about websites and paper, and words about words. i sincerely hope that my presentation of content is not only typographically educational, but even somewhat exciting and engaging.</p>&nbsp;
    <p>as you may have amassed, i care a lot about these things. words, yes, but it's bigger than them alone. it's about the  <i>things</i> those <i>things</i> can create, and things that people <i>have already created</i> from the things. not to mention all of the things to come! there's a whole word-world of things to appreciate and be inspired by. and a piece of me hopes that for someone, somewhere, this thing can be <i>that thing.</i> if you know what i mean.</p>&nbsp;
    <p>though this thing would not be in the state that it is in had it not been for the things that came before it. (and the creators of those things!)</p>&nbsp;
    <p>so, my reader, my beloved, this is my garden of things. i encourage you to pick and prod and sniff and smell. appreciate every<i>thing</i> that has made this thing what it is. and, sincerely, every person who's made this person who <i>she</i> is.</p>
