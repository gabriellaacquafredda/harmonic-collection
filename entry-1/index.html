            &nbsp;
            <p>though if i may, i think the right word in this case is 'fledgling.'</p>
            <p><i>fledgling</i> meaning emergent. promising, young, budding, rising, infant. literally, 'a young bird that has just fledged;' and hopefully, one who's linguistic instincts carry her safely to the ground after being thrown from the metaphorical nest.</p>
            <p>birds aside, i am a writer because i love words. i love rhyme and reason, and alliteration, and repetition, and excess. breaks in form. typographic theory. consonance. big words. like 'consonance.' long, somewhat-insufferably-hyphenated-and-made-up words. semi-colons, and oxford commas. and repetition. and lengthy asides. and long sentences, with far too many commas, and questionable grammar. and direct addresses. my reader, you. i love you, too. and i love serif on a webpage. sans on a white page. beige page. high-thread count. nice papers for nice words. nice words that speak nice things into existence and whisper everything else. and i love <i>love.</i> easily written professions of love. love songs, love letters, lovely notes in lovely books, lovely notes in the pseudo-margins of our lives.
               <i>i love words.</i>
