  <p class="thanks"> thank you for trusting me. </p>
  <p> i realize there's still a great deal we don't know about eachother. you trusted me out of the goodness of your heart.

    <p>i suppose you could credit all of the above to 'basic literacy.' but such a phrase wouldn't be possible without the letterforms
      constructing it, no? not to mention the snide colloquialisms and double entendres kept warm between them. but we'll save the latter.</p>

<h5>baby's first words</h5>
    <p>are a milestone for any parent. and let it be known that the written word is very proud. and wealthy: rich in context and content.</p>
    <p>linguists and anthropologists claim that spoken language was born around 35,000 BCE
      (only 360,246 months old! and it's gotten so big already!) to cro-magnon men.
      these early men painted very sophisticated pieces on their cave walls: depicting scenes with 
      some kind of narrative; thus suggesting some kind of verbal communication to go along with it. </p>
